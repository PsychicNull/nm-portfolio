                                So, for instance, in the series of drawings <i>Like it Is</i>, where you're photo-copying book pages, and then you create an enlarged drawing of the photocopy, it moves the text and the object into abstraction. Rendering of it reinforces even further abstraction. Is there a way in which you apply that kind of keenness to the narrative, and what it presumes? To the structure of that work? 
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">Nyeema Morgan</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                By drawing the title page, the paratext, you don't have access to the content of the book. I'm reconditioning your relationship to that content material. You can't move any closer to the content, but you can move through several layers of the image because the surface isn't as shallow as it may appear. With the empty space, shadows from outside the picture, the image of the book and the black space of the machine, constitute the surface of the drawing
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NY</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                The surface of the story you were just telling about the artist, about the genius of the artist as essentially in opposition to the structure of the institution, is that the surface of the story? What's beneath that surface of the story is the presumption, a set of permissions, that any artist can work that way. And artists <i>should</i> work that way. That excludes women, especially Black women, and people of color in general.
                            </p>

                                This is what Adrian Piper was alluding to in her essay on art world politics where she says freedom of expression isn't a right, but a privilege granted to a legitimate subject of rights. Well, who is that “legitimate subject”? The presumption is that the recipient is an idealized subject.
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NY</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                The analogy may break down. Can you identify the power within the structure of, for instance, the way that you're thinking about the <i>Like it Is </i>series? 
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NM</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                If I'm understanding your question correctly, it's in the conventions of how we read and construct images and conventions of representation, how images and information move through the world. 
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NY</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                And the book, I'm kind of thinking of the object&mdash;
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NM</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                &mdash;within that body of drawings, I'm focusing on books with the word extraordinary in the title. They range from anything like self-help to how to play a better golf game to law books. The specificity of the book doesn't really matter, or the word extraordinary for that matter. The word is an anchor and flows through different uses and different contexts.
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NY</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                Right, right, right. Because I was thinking about the object, or the system of publication, as a location of power. Also, the word <i>extraordinary</i> itself puts the book into the context of authority; it causes one to think of the book as an authoritative object. I mean, it already is an authoritative object. 
                            </p>

                            <p class="interview-name">NM</p>
                            <p class="interview-text">
                                Because it's in print, it's published. The focal point is the context of the image, information, and reading. In the drawings there's a lot of uneven “margin space” on all sides of the image. Sometimes there's just as much, or more, empty white space as there is drawing. But rather than it serving as a neutral, unoccupied space that registers the image, it's a space that can be occupied by an image, the shadows. For me, it feels transgressive like when I was younger and would doodle in the margins of my textbooks.
