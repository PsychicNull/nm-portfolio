                                In your practice you focus on text, but you also make pieces like <i>Untitled No. 1 (I, Rhinoceros)</i> (2014), which is a sculpture. What's that piece about?

                                As I move through different works, there are moments where I'm trying to reconcile text and image, object and image, object and text. For that work, <i>Untitled No. 1 (I, Rhinoceros)</i>, the reference is to Dürer's <i>Rhinoceros</i> (1515). I had been attracted to that work for a long time but it wasn't until recently that I realized the story of its conception was more important to me than the object— the print. Durer was commissioned to create a representation of this exotic animal, but it wasn't made from firsthand experience, but from a story. Someone wrote a description of the rhinoceros; someone who had seen it. Once the rhinoceros had been imported to the region and people could actually see this animal, more accurate representations supplanted Dürer's. I was grappling with questions of representation and authenticity, and also my relationship as an artist to an audience, to a viewer. I had questions about my relationship to that audience. I make my work: I need to make my work. It is important that it has a life outside of my making and outside of the studio. I was asking myself: what is it that I need from the viewer? I was also wondering, “is there any reciprocation?”. When a person walks across the threshold of a gallery or museum, what is it that they anticipate receiving? <i>Untitled No. 1 (I, Rhinoceros)</i> is where I wanted to implicate myself in the relationship between artist and viewer—so those are my cast hands holding these found vessels which were mass produced lamps I suppose. I used to have a studio in Industry City in Brooklyn: in the mid aughts there were a lot of manufacturers there and sometimes they'd trash a shit-ton of mass-produced things. I pulled these absurd objects because they reference to old world objects with their classical motifs, but they're grossly mass-produced objects. Again, reproduction and materiality runs heavily through this work as it does in much of my work. The castings of my hands—there are subtle variations in how they're holding these identical vessels and they're installed at a specific height where there's ambiguity with the gesture in terms of whether it's an offering or a receptacle.
