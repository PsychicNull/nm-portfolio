                            So, I think this is a good lead-in to a question I had about the most recent works, The Set-Up.
                        </p>

                            The titles of the sculptures are actually the beginnings of a joke. And then, in parentheses afterwards, it’s “the set-up.”
                        </p>

                        <div class="text-name">NY:</div>
                        <p class="interview-text">
                            Oh, okay. I haven’t seen those two sculptures completely finished, but we talked about them quite a bit while you were making them. And I can imagine them.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="text-name">NM:</div>
                        <p class="interview-text">
                            Yeah, the sculptures provide the foundation for the show and what I was thinking about, dealing with catharsis and different kinds of narrative structures and narrative forms. To refresh your imagination, they’re these two-plinth type, institutional objects with a white, high-gloss finish. It’s reflective. And there’s quite a few things happening on the surface: holes and openings whose origins are ambiguous. The sides of one of the sculptures is peeled away from the frame structure underneath, again toggling back and forth between form and structure. 
                       </p>
                    </div>
                            
                    <div class="work-container-2">    
                        <p class="interview-text">    
                            There are also areas where the surface has been disrupted by a body, grabbed or something like that. And then there’s awkwardly located embellishments on the surface. Those come from the frames that I sculpted for Soft Power. Hard Margins. But the “coop de graycee,” as Porky Pig used to say, is a card sitting on top of each sculpture. Printed on each card is the beginning of the joke. One reads, “A priest, a rabbi, and a minister walk into a bar” and the other says, “A whore, a nun, and a housewife walk into a barn.” Just the set-ups.
                        </p>
                        
                        <div class="text-name">NY:</div>
                        <p class="interview-text">
                            So my question is about the catharsis of the punchline. The sculptures came out of your thinking about catharsis, via humor, via thinking about Dave Chappelle.
                        </p>

                            Humor, comedy, has always had a strong presence in my life. I guess it's my coping mechanism. My mom loved theatrical drama so whenever I performed in the home, whether it was singing or jokes or dancing or reciting, it was comedic amalgam. My mom would perform a song and dance from The Wiz or my dad would jump out his studio and into the living room while we were watching The Wizard of Oz and do the Lollipop Guild bit in perfect time. And they’d listen to [Eddie] Murphy, [Bill] Cosby, and [Richard] Pryor, which I wasn’t allowed to listen to in their presence. I knew how to make people laugh. In fact, when I was in grade school in the South, I used to get picked on a lot. I was quiet and I talked “white” and was too smart for my own good. I also wore my hair naturally which wasn’t popular in the ’80s, especially as a pre-teen.

                            There was this kid, Trey, who persistently took time out of his day to humiliate me in front of the class. One day I just had enough, and I went off on him with this five-minute improvised bit—I dug deep. Something about the size of his forehead and being able to see into the future, about his mama, everything. I could see him just wither and tear up. The teacher kept yelling at me to stop, but I was intoxicated by the laughter. It was the only time I ever went to detention. I didn’t end up going. My mom must have made one of her trips to talk to the principal. (laughter) From that day on, all the mean kids at school used to come to me at lunch to write a diss about someone they had beef with. Kids used to play the dozens at the playground with the material I wrote. It bought me protection from there on out!

                            Like I said, it's a defense mechanism. In fact, when I’m really scared, I laugh or smile. With a lot of the work I make, the subject is pretty heavy or somber, but there's an injection of the absurd or humor. So even before these new sculptures I made, but also, the work that I did before. The large horror horror print installation. I made that work in 2018. There’s a part of that installation that’s black rubber circles on the floor, a nod to the kind of absurd violence in cartoons, that kind of Warner Brothers slapstick of Wile E. Coyote falling into the hole. If you watched the Road Runner cartoons, the idea was that the coyote was in this perpetual pursuit of the Road Runner, caught in this Sisyphean death cycle. He would devise these different traps and they would all fail, so he’d fall victim to his own trap. Wait, actually all the traps were manufactured by ACME so the failure wasn’t so much his. It was a dubious product! Anyway, the black circle was one of those traps. He would take out his can of ACME paint and then paint the circle. The Road Runner would run right over it, so Coyote would be miffed and start investigating the hole—picking it up, moving it. Then he’d stand on it himself and fall in.
