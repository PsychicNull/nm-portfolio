                                Political violence, the extra-ordinary assertions of common people and the
                                productive/reproductive hand of the artist are the subject matters that concern us in this
                                eclectic group of artworks by multidisciplinary artist Nyeema Morgan. Human suffering is
                                real and it is an epistemological necessity to acknowledge suffering if we are to know truth.
                                The aesthetics of the non-identical are an unscripted interaction between differing aesthetic
                                patterns and classifications, arranged into “constellations” around subject matter. This
                                arranging or rearranging of logically derived forms, expressively malleable gestures and
                                memetic legibility unlocks the historical structures that limit the identity of objectified human
                                beings to the boundaries proscribed by classification.

                                In Morgan's exhibition “horror horror” membership within identical sets and near-identical
                                series offer objects—and objectified human beings—an opportunity to express identity in
                                spite of the limitations of object-hood. Identity first occurs to us in our thoughts (“all X are
                                X”); societal exchanges then force us to impose identity onto objects (“any barrel of X is
                                worth any 12 bushels of Y”). We then find identities for ourselves by analogy with objects as
                                deficits, credits and assets to our communities. In all these cases, identity unifies, but it also
                                suppresses the diversities and differences that make beings, thoughts, subjects and objects
                                real.

                                These prints, drawings and sculptures are parts within identical sets and near identical
                                series. These sets and series are families that individual works simultaneously belong to
                                and vanish beneath. To think is to identify, and the semblance of identity always exists
                                within thought itself, even in its attempt to identify truth. Identity is overcome by testing its
                                heterogeneous object against the unity of our conception of it. This collision forces thought
                                to surpass itself and forces us to acknowledge our consciousness of our own nonidentity.

                                Minute, representational rendering in multiple mediums and materials collides with a
                                discursive, meta-critical treatment of subject and relationship in each group of permutations.
                                The difference between pictorial and discursive representation—like the difference between
                                analog and digital representation—is a function of "off" and "on." Analog representations
                                present continuously variable properties like minutely modulated shading, carefully modeled
                                contours, and subtly shifting hues. Digital representation on the other hand, is discrete; a
                                drawing either is or is not a copy of such and such a book. In Morgan's work there is no
                                ambiguity about the subject matter of her representations: they are not “more or less”
                                representations of a given object.

                                These objects are hybrid representations: pre-labeled but not pre-interpreted, symbol-filled
                                arrays, arranged into larger and larger arrays rhizomatically relating back upon identity and
                                non-identity. We are constructed as objects of social use with no possible existence outside
                                of a social existence. We were ultimately "made for each other." Our objectivity can never
                                be eliminated or replaced entirely by subjectivity, but or object-hood is an historical,
                                provisional and relational phenomenon. As such it can and will change. Even in our object-
                                hood we can never be fully known, but we can and should be fully honored in our difference
                                and non-identity.

                                "horror horror" is an exhibition defined by antagonisms, identifications, reproductions and
                                technical masteries. Exposing these antagonisms points us towards their resolution and a
                                thoughtful relationship between subject-matter, object-matter and concept.
