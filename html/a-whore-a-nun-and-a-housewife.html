                                The “set-up” ultimately comes back to voice. Atop two altered, white pedestals &#45; generally taken to be the support structure for an artwork, but here activated as the artwork itself &#45; sit small folded cards. Each card bears a variation on the “_____ walks into a bar” convention, addressing the reader in the voice of the archetypal comedian. The rigidity, the mechanization of the form itself, allows for the familiarity of phrasing that conjures the trope of this voice in addition to (and sometimes overlapping with) that of the artist/author herself.

                            <p class="interview-text">
                                The conventional set-up of both comedy and tragedy tends to be the same: a social or political problem persists due to forces beyond individual human control (the set-up), a character takes on this problem in an attempt to offer solutions, expectations are subverted. In tragedy, the hero pays a debt to the cause; in comedy, the protagonist draws attention to the ridiculousness of the situation, often calling for a need for a shift in cultural values. Thus, the set-up may be accentuated as a framing device; however, the notion of being set-up or being framed can exist either as a comedic trope (“I've been framed!”) or a tragic debt to be paid that is (sometimes) recorded in the annals of history. A set-up without resolution risks a potential misattribution of voice, not necessarily withholding catharsis, but denying a corrective — a failsafe temporarily overridden.

                                When offered a lexicon of framing devices in the form of the set-up, the pedestal-as-artwork, the PDFs, I am left alone with the mechanism (or thus, mechanization) of the voice. Denied the punchline or resolution, acutely reinforced by my vantage point as a twice-removed audience member, I am without the necessary means to parse the distinction between artistic voice, comedic voice, historical voice, or institutional voice; I am temporarily suspended above the elasticity of shifting and moving parts. Forced to sit with the set-up— or in my case, layers of set-ups — I am left to wonder what the resolution that prompts the new societal safeguard might be. To tie the machinations of satire to fixed points would be to miss the durational shifts (in irony, these would be the emergent oppositional values) perhaps unintentionally tipping the comedian into the realm of the tragic figure.
